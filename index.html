          <h2>Talk about yourself</h2>
          <p>
            I’m Caleb, a driven learner and builder. I study software
            engineering with Altschoolafrica, constantly sharpening my skills in frontend and
            full-stack development. I’m passionate about creating solutions that
            address real problems in Nigeria, like rental transparency and
            content scheduling. Resilient through challenges, I stay focused on
            growth, impact, and consistency.
